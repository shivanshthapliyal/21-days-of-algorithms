# 21-days-of-algorithms
I set the challenge for myself to implement as many algorithms as I can in 21 days.

## [Day - 1](day-1-sorting/)
### Sorting Techniques
#### [Merge Sort](day-1-sorting/merge-sort.py) 

#### [Quick Sort](day-1-sorting/quick-sort.py) 

#### [Insertion Sort](day-1-sorting/insertion-sort.py) 

---

## [Day - 2](day-2-graph/)
### Graph
#### [Breadth First Search (BFS)](day-2-graph/graph-bfs.py) 
- Unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array in this implementation.
---
#### [Depth First Search (DFS)](day-2-graph/graph-dfs.py) 
- Unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array in this implementation.
---
#### [Dijkstra's Algorithm](day-2-graph/graph-dijkstra.py) 
- Shortest Path from source to all vertices.
