# 21-days-of-algorithms
I set the challenge for myself to implement as many algorithms as I can in 21 days.

## [Day - 1](day-1-sorting/)
### Sorting Techniques
#### [Merge Sort](day-1-sorting/merge-sort.py) 
> A divide and conquer sorting approach which has a time-complexity of O(n log(n)).
A stable sort - if two values are equal, the relative order prior to sorting will be maintained
Space complexity of merge sort is  O (n).
Merge sort scales well with large amounts of data.
